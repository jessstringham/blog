I cheated a little in the hopes of winning at New Year's
Resolutions 2016. Last fall, I started to look for good habits I was
already developing, and tried to shape them into something
constructive.

One of those habits was reading and listening more, and to higher
quality content. I used to spend too much time lurking on Reddit,
reading online discussions. I've replaced most of that with reading
longer and usually more thoughtful pieces, like blog posts, articles,
and podcasts.

The appetite for this fancier content grew into a craving for even
longer, in-depth stories. Something like *Serial*. Or books. Indeed. I
dug up my old Kindle. I read paper books. I subscribed to Audible. I
finished a modest stack of acclaimed non-fiction books. *Look at me!
Such an adult! So productive!*

This is great. Since graduating, I've been panicking about leaving 16
years of structured education. The real world experience has been
great, but the learning part of it seems haphazard and inefficient on
its own. My best guess was to augment it by reading books, and that's
what I was doing.

However, this habit wasn't perfect. When I thought back to one of the
books I had read, all I found was a one-sentence summary and a hazy
memory of my feelings. *"Oh, I read that! It was about food. I liked
it."* I'd like more than check marks next to the things I've read.

To counter this, I started recording and reviewing the key points and
interesting quotes from what I've read. If I stick with it, I'll
continue to extract knowledge from reading long after I finish the
book.

For example, instead of checking Hacker News for the 3rd time one day,
I could choose to spend a few minutes reviewing the excellent
things I read in the past.

I might get a card from *The Pragmatic Programmer*'s tips about
software development:

> **Put Abstractions in Code, Details in Metadata**: Program for the
> general case, and put the specifics outside the compiled code base.

followed by

> Get people talking. Learn to ask questions that will elicit answers
> about what is most interesting or vivid in their lives. Nothing so
> animates writing as someone telling what he thinks or what he
> does--in his own words.

from William Zinsser's *On Writing Well*.

It's like school again! But even more enjoyable than school, there's
no pressure, and the material is delightfully diverse and
personalized.

I started reviewing six weeks ago, and I dig it. I'm getting more out
of it than I originally thought. Namely:

 - **I find new connections and interpretations.** I might be working
   on a new project and the old note takes on new meaning. It doesn't
   happen all the time, but it's awesome when it does.
 - Even in the worst case, when I'm not interested in the card's
 contents and quickly skip to the next one, **I'm reminded of the
 things I've read**, the original reason for trying this.
- The most surprising thing is that **the reviews are fun.** When I'm
 choosing which app to pass the time with, the review calls to me in
 the same way Hacker News or Medium do.

   
Onward to 2016, with more books, articles, and podcasts to be
consumed, and reviewing in real life.

I have a few more posts about implementation coming soon. In the meantime:

 - [Anki](http://ankisrs.net) is the app I'm using. Spoilers, it's
   great for some use cases, but it's not particularly great this one.
 - [Janky Method](http://www.jackkinsella.ie/2011/12/05/janki-method.html) for using Anki to learn programming.
 - Coding Horror has the Pragmatic Programmer's tips in ["A Pragmatic Quick Reference"](http://blog.codinghorror.com/a-pragmatic-quick-reference/)
