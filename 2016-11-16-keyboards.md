I've reflected a lot since last Tuesday. One of my personal
revelations is that I need to stop being silent and start standing up
for peace and love and understanding. But today, I'm going to talk
about techie gadgets. Baby steps.

### Digression

Well, first I want to say that posting an unrelated and seemingly
frivolous post feels weird and small this week. But it's related in a
selfish way.

See, I'm self-conscious about how clumsy I communicate. When I try to
talk about big things, the sentences I string together aren't what I'm
going after. The thoughts come out piecemeal. It's too
melodramatic. It's full of jargon. It sounds like I'm out of touch no
matter what I'm talking about. It's so full of footnotes I can't get
my message across. Or I change my mind as soon as it's out of my
mouth.

And so when I have something big to say, I tend to keep quiet.

I realized that it didn't have to be this way. So I'm working on
it. One way is posting on this blog. Another is processing the big
things through journaling.

Now then. My Bluetooth keyboard. Blog posts and journaling. In my
world, it's relevant.

## Journaling

Journaling is the very best. I totally recommend it to everyone.

### Digital scribbles

I prefer writing with a keyboard to writing with a pen. Because I
chose to tie my journaling to digital devices, it was easier to start
reading articles than it was to scribble down notes. I could be
reading an article within seconds of picking up my phone. But writing
down my thoughts meant being hunched over my old laptop, clearing
notifications, and waiting for Emacs to start while my laptop
preferred to use up the CPU syncing photos and checking for updates.


### The Blue Bluetooth keyboard

Then I bought a Bluetooth keyboard that could pair with my phone. It's
blue with circular keys. It's full size, but compact enough so it can
fit in my purse. It's rigid, so I can set it on my lap and it supports
itself.

My usage goes like this: I connect the keyboard to my phone, open my
favorite journaling app, and put the phone aside. I put the keyboard
on the table, or, if I'm sitting on the ground or on public
transportation, my knees.

Then I start typing. I don't look at the screen, except to
occasionally check that no journal catastrophe has happened, like a
surprise lock screen or the cursor jumping.

I know using a keyboard without a screen looks weird. Though at first,
questioning the conventions of smartphone usage was thrilling on its
own.

Something unexpected was that the keyboard-phone set up liberates my
eyes. I don't need to look at the keyboard or the screen. I can stare
out into the distance. Or describe what I see while I'm looking at
it. I can even turn off the lights and start to drift to sleep, while
still transcribing my stream of consciousness.

### One year next Sunday

I've used the little blue Bluetooth keyboard for about a year
now. It's been a trusty companion through many reflections, like about
how much better I could be at communicating, or about what I was going
to do about last week.
