I gotta be honest with you: Sometimes I edit posts after publishing
them. I fix typos and fix sentences that make no sense.

I've manually added Edit sections. But in the interest of automation
and transparency, I just added a "Post History" link to all posts. The
link goes to a GitHub page that shows every change I've made to that
blog post.

### Version Control

There's an awesome tool called version control systems. If you haven't
heard about them, oh man, let me tell you. It makes it easier to
iterate and collaborate on files. Notably, it helps with the
`draft-draft-v1-final-draft.doc` problem.

Post History is powered by a version control system, git, and GitHub
provides a pretty UI for git repositories.

### post history v1

Here's an example: I fixed a typo in [my Talking LED post]({% post_url 2016-11-07-raspberry-pi-talking-led %}). You can click on the Post
History button, and see all of the
[changes](https://github.com/jessstringham/blog/commits/1c2ee2f1b15b6cc9a15945be2994d8f377f0ad4c/2016-11-07-raspberry-pi-talking-led.md)
I've made to the Talking LED post, including this
[particular change](https://github.com/jessstringham/blog/commit/1c2ee2f1b15b6cc9a15945be2994d8f377f0ad4c#diff-121fad72f4aaf7cae523bd07c8d888cd).

## Technical stuff

This blog is built in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).  If you're
familiar with Jekyll, you might know you can host your Jekyll blog
from GitHub using
[GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/).

#### _posts

But I'm not doing that. I don't have a big reason. I just like my
local Jekyll set up, and wasn't ready to shuffle around all of my
files or share my hacktastical deploy scripts with the world. Instead,
only the posts are in the public repo. I did split out the `_posts`
folder of my local private repo, so you get the behind-the-scenes of
the last year of blog posts.

#### links

Adding the links was just a matter of using the `page.path`
variable. It's description even says "Example usage: Linking back to
the page or post’s source on GitHub."

So in the post template, I have

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
    <a href="https://github.com/jessstringham/blog/commits/master/{{page.path | remove_first: '_posts/'}}">Post History</a>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The awkward `remove_first` is there because I only committed the posts
files.


### Backlog

This was an easy way to get post history in an afternoon. But it's not
perfect. I worry that it's inaccessible to folks who aren't already
familiar with `git`.
