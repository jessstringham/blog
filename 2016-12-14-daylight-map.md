I think this is kinda cool: I made a visualization of the length of
the day in the cities I've been in.

### Why?

In Sweden, people talk about the length of the day in the same way
people talk about the weather.

Sites like
[timeanddate.com](http://www.timeanddate.com/sun/sweden/stockholm)
have these cool visualizations for how long the day is. (Surprise, the
site is based out of Norway!)

I can recreate a few. For example, here's Los Angeles's, at 30°N.

And here's Tromsø, Norway, at 70°N.

I think these are a cool mix of astronomy, squiggly lines, and places
in the world.

### What

I used a dataset of where I lived over the last few years. I computed
the amount of daylight in a given place on a given day. The result is
like a bunch of those above graphs squashed together, like a piecewise
function.

It especially highlights things like when I moved to California, or
when I visited Tromsø and the sun didn't come up.
