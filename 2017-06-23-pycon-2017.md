title: My talk at PyCon 2017 about Experiment Assignment

I haven't posted for a while because I was getting ready for my first
tech conference talk, which I gave at PyCon 2017 in Portland last
month.

My talk was about an angle of A/B tests that I hadn't seen before: in
most talks on A/B Tests, there's this black box that "randomly assigns
visitors to see either _A_ or _B_". At Yelp, I led a small team that
implemented the experiment assignment library. I thought I was in a
good position to explain what could go on in that black box (using
Python) and why it mattered to everyone else running experiments.

## Other PyCon talks

It was my first talk at a tech conference, and the Green Room was
great. I went there and nervous-chatted with a bunch of folks,
including
[David Wolever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5_5XmmwMx8), who
organized the Green Room! (Awesome!) and then gave a cool talk on
disassembling Python code, and
[Michelle Fullwood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e0TbyCkbCY), who
gave an informative talk on TensorFlow!


While I'm at it, I also learned a lot about things I've been meaning
to look into, like stream processing by
[some fellow Yelpers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHCC2ITcMfk). [One Data Pipeline to Rule them All](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6riK1Xtyng)
is a nice overview data pipelines, which could have been useful last
year before I started contributing to Yelp's data pipeline.
