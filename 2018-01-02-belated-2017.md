It's the beginning of 2018! Here are some stats and books from my 2017.


The biggest thing this year was that I quit my job and moved to the UK to
do a Masters degree in AI.

Here's an updated <a href='{% post_url 2016-12-14-daylight-map %}'>daylight graph</a>:

## Habits and achievements

### Things I'm proud of

- Reading a lot of books!
- Not being nervous before giving my first talk at a conference! That made me feel awesome.


### Habits I think are useful

- Started a personal wiki, and started writing reflections for classes, articles, books, and weeks.
- Making an index card every night listing a few little goals for the next day. I also write a few notes,
and more recently doodled, on the previous day's index card as a little journal entry.
- Better food habits. I started enjoying oatmeal and ate more leafy greens.

## Programming

Most of my personal projects were around Jupyter. I also worked with numpy and scipy.

### Personal Projects

#### Wiki
  - One part is a wiki based on markdown files.
  - The other part is a heavily customized Jupyter notebook.
     - Searchable using custom searching utility that's hooked into Alfred.
     - Notebook markdown cells become flashcards.
     - Blog post about this coming soon!

#### This blog's deployment

I containerized building it.

I also successfully used my deployment scripts after not using them in a few months.
I was able to figure it out and they still worked! Engineering win!

#### Implementing A/B Tests randomization

Here are some [notebooks](https://github.com/jessstringham/talks/tree/master/pycon2017-experiment-assignment-on-the-web) about it.

#### Data

Learned a lot about numpy, scipy, and machine learning.


## Places and events

### Home bases

* Seattle
* Sweden
* Portland
* Edinburgh

Phew.

### New places

* Maui. Albin showed me how to do beach vacations like a Swede: you, like, just sit on the beach in the sun and read. But my favorite part of the trip was seeing Haleakala Crater.
* Lake Crescent on the Olympic Peninsula. \*Mount Eerie music playing.\*
* More cities in northern Scandinavia: [Narvik, Norway and Kiruna, Sweden.]({% post_url 2018-01-04-narvik-kiruna %}) \*Röyksopp music playing.\*
* Vancouver, BC (technically I've been here before, but it's been a long time!)
* Inverness, in the Scottish Highlands
* London

### Events

- Women's March in Seattle
- My dad and I saw the solar eclipse. Totality was just a few miles south of where we live! I've been looking forward to this since I was a kid.
- :( Columbia Gorge burning and it raining ash in Portland


## Favorites!

### Podcasts

- **Rough Translation**
- **NPR Politics**
- **The Daily** and **UpFirst**
- **Pod Save America**
- Also, audiobooks! I found out I can check out audiobooks from libraries using Overdrive.

Podcasts I started later in the year:

- **Slow Burn** (about Watergate)
- **The Indicator** (yay, more frequent planet money)
- **I Only Listen to the Mountain Goats**. (Jason Fink from Welcome to Nightvale, and John Darnielle from the Mountain Goats talking about creating!? I also read one of John Darnielle's novels.)

At the beginning of the year, I listened to a lot of data science podcasts. My favorites were:

- **Talking Machines**
- **Linear Digressions**

### Books

In 2017, I starting to write personal reviews of books and articles. This was a good idea!
It made me reflect. I can also go back and remember what it was like to read the story.

And I read 68 books! The full list is [on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/show/5493-2017-reading-challenge).

Here are a couple of highlights:


#### Favorites
- **The Unbearable Lightness of Being** - Milan Kundera
- **The Broken Earth Series** - N.K. Jemisin
- **One Hundred Years of Solitude** - Gabriel García Márquez
- **Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas** - Hunter S. Thompson
- **Sound and the Fury** - William Faulkner
- **The Tin Drum** - Günter Grass
- **A Room of One's Own** - Virginia Woolf
 - John McPhee's books


#### Technical-y books

I'm always searching for more books like Feynman's QED. I found a couple:

 - **An Introduction to Information Theory: Symbols, Signals and Noise** - John R Pierce
 - **The Annotated Turing** - Charles Petzold

And sometimes I just read textbooks

 - **Introduction to Statistical Learning** (this one is short and readable!)
 - **Statistics for Experimenters** (this one is pretty readable too, but I classify this as a "Jessica is weird" reading book. I read the 1970s one and it was interesting to see the examples they used, like factories putting raisins in cereal.)


#### Data and learning

I'm learning more math. So I read a bunch of books on learning, and one on math!
Here are some of my favorites:

 - **Weapons of Math Destruction** - Cathy O'Neil
 - **Make it Stick** - Peter C. Brown
 - **Deep Work** - Cal Newport (I played the audiobook on double speed and wandered around Vancouver.)


### Bonus

 - **A Princess of Mars** - Edgar Rice Burroughs. Did you know the author of Tarzan also wrote pulp fiction a century ago about a guy getting transported to Mars and having to save a princess?

## 2017 Music

Grizzly Bear's **Veckatimest**.

Other than that, I mostly listened to old favorites.
