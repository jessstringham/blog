Now I have [priors on the weights]({% post_url 2018-01-03-bayesian-linreg %}) and [observations]({% post_url 2018-01-08-bayesian-linreg-sample %}), and I used this to come up with [the mean and variance of the posterior on the weights]({% post_url 2018-01-09-bayesian-linreg-posterior %}). In this post, I'll show some cool plots.



## Sampling from the posterior

Much like how I [sampled from the prior]({% post_url 2018-01-03-bayesian-linreg %}), I can sample weights from the posterior.

{% highlight python %}
grid_size = 0.01
x_grid = np.arange(-1, 1, grid_size)[:, None]
N = 100

Phi_X = np.hstack((
    np.ones((x_grid.shape[0], 1)),  # pad with 1s for the bias term
    x_grid
))

w = np.random.randn(N, 2) @ np.linalg.cholesky(V_n) + w_n.T

plt.clf()
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(x_grid, Phi_X @ w.T, '-m', alpha=.2, label='weights sampled from posterior')
plt.plot(X_in, y, 'xk', label='observations')
plt.legend(*get_dedup_labels(plt))
plt.show()
{% endhighlight %}

#### Quick aside

Above I plot a 2D array to plot multiple lines, which makes matplotlib create a lot of duplicate labels. I'm not sure if plotting matrix is a bad idea to start with, but I did it anyway and used a `dedup_labels` helper function to deduplicate labels:

{% highlight python %}
# hrm, plotting the matrix made for `N` duplicate labels.
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26337493/pyplot-combine-multiple-line-labels-in-legend
def dedup_labels(plt):
    handles, labels = plt.gca().get_legend_handles_labels()
    new_handles = []
    new_labels = []
    for handle, label in zip(handles, labels):
        if label not in new_labels:
            new_handles.append(handle)
            new_labels.append(label)
    return new_handles, new_labels
{% endhighlight %}


## Prediction with uncertainty

I can also use `V_n` to compute the uncertainty of predictions. The prediction is the true function with some added noise:

$$y = f(\textbf x) + v$$

where \\(v \sim \mathcal N(0, \sigma_y^2)\\). With a little math, I can compute the mean and variance of the prediction posterior's Gaussian distribution. It's [also given in the course notes](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlpr/2017/notes/w7a_bayesian_inference_prediction.html#predictions-for-bayesian-linear-regression).

Then I can take the square root of that to get the standard deviation and plot [2 standard deviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68–95–99.7_rule) from the mean. In code:

{% highlight python %}
grid_size = 0.01
x_grid = np.arange(-1, 1, grid_size)[:, None]

Phi_X = np.hstack((
    np.ones((x_grid.shape[0], 1)),  # pad with 1s for the bias term
    x_grid
))

stdev_pred = np.sqrt(np.sum(np.dot(Phi_X, V_n) * Phi_X, 1)[:, None] + sigma_y**2)

upper_bound = Phi_X @ w_n + 2 * stdev_pred
lower_bound = Phi_X @ w_n - 2 * stdev_pred


plt.clf()
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(X_in, y, 'xk', label='observations')
# I think fill_between wants 1D arrays
plt.fill_between(x_grid[:, 0], lower_bound[:, 0], upper_bound[:, 0], alpha=0.2, label='two standard deviations')
plt.plot(x_grid, Phi_X @ w_n, label='mean prediction')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
{% endhighlight %}

Neat!

If I zoom out like I do below, it's clearer that the shaded area is squeezed around the observations. That's saying there is less uncertainty around where the observations are. That's intuitive; I should be more certain of my prediction around observations.

### Comparison

The difference between these two plots confused me at first but sorting it out was instructive.

In the first plot, I'm sampling from the distribution of the *weights*. I hear sampling from the weights' distribution is not always easy to do. It turns out to be easy when doing Bayesian linear regression using Gaussians for everything.

The second plot shows the distribution of the *prediction*. This is related to the distribution of the weights (equation from [the course notes](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlpr/2017/notes/w7a_bayesian_inference_prediction.html#predictions-for-bayesian-linear-regression)):

$$p(y|\mathbf x, \mathcal D) = \int p(y | \mathbf x, \mathbf w) p(\mathbf w|\mathcal D) \, d \mathbf w$$

If I look at a single weight sampled from the weight's posterior, I can plot
\\( p\(y|\mathbf x, \mathbf w\) \\)
which for each \\(\mathbf x\\) is \\(\mathcal N(y; \mathbf w^{\top} \mathbf x, \sigma_y^2)\\). If I plot it, I get:

![Graph showing x's for observations, a line for one sample of the weights, and shaded area for uncertainty.](/assets/2018-01-10-sample-with-error.png)

To get the prediction, I use the integral, which does a weighted sum (or [expectation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value)!) over a bunch (all) of these. Then I get:

### Bonus: basis functions

With linear regression, I can also use basis functions to match even cooler functions.
For fun, I tried polynomials by using a different \\(\Phi \\). The true function was a quadratic. This shows
trying to fit a 5 degree polynomial to it:


{% highlight python %}
model_params = 6  # highest degree + 1
Phi_X_in = np.hstack(X_in**i for i in range(model_params))
{% endhighlight %}

Sampling priors gave me lots of squiggles. (It also reminds me of my hair a few years ago!)

![Very squiggly lines.](/assets/2018-01-10-five-degrees.png)

I can plot the uncertainty.

![Uncertainty of 5-degree polynomial. It's very high far away from observations, and low close to observations.](/assets/2018-01-10-five-degrees-uncertainty-few.png)

I also can add a few more points from the underlying function and see how it changes.

![Uncertainty of 5-degree polynomial. It's very high far away from observations, and low close to observations. Now there's another observation far to the right, where the uncertainty pinches around it.](/assets/2018-01-10-five-degrees-uncertainty-another-point.png)
