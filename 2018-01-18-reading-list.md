I started reading books regularly in the last few years, and now I have a long enough list to do data projects with! I have a YAML file of the books I've read, so I used [Jekyll's data files](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/) to generate a [page that lists the books I've read/listened to]({% link reading.html %}).
