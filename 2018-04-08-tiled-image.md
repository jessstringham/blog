Here's a quick blog post to celebrate turning in my last coursework for my master's.

There was this video of using a pasta machine to creatively split an image into four images. It felt like a `numpy` challenge, so I tried to faithfully reproduce it!

If I want the pasta width to be a pixel, the code is kind of cute:

But that doesn't quite look like the original, so here's how I could do it with a wider pasta setting.
