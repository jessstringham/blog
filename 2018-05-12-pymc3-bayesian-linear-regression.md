In this post, I'll revisit the [Bayesian linear regression]({% post_url 2018-01-03-bayesian-linreg %}) series, but use [`pymc3`](https://docs.pymc.io).

I'm still a little fuzzy on how `pymc3` things work. Luckily it turns out that `pymc3`'s [getting started tutorial](http://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/getting_started) includes this task.




## Data generation

Data generation corresponds to [Bayesian Linear Regression part 2: demo data]({% post_url 2018-01-08-bayesian-linreg-sample %}) (The order of the first two posts of the original series are interchangeable.)

I need to generate observed data to learn from. I'll use the same model as before where the underlying function \\( f \\) is a line:

$$f = mx + b.$$

There's Gaussian noise on the observations, so the observed values are

$$\epsilon \sim \mathcal N(0, \sigma_y)$$
$$y = f + \epsilon.$$

Like the `pymc3` tutorial and my old posts, I'll generate observed data with `numpy`:



{% highlight python %}
N_points = 11

x = 2 * np.random.rand(N_points, 1) - 1

true_sigma_y = 0.1

def f(x):
    return 0.3 * x + 2

noise = true_sigma_y * np.random.randn(x.shape[0], 1)

Y = f(x) + noise
{% endhighlight %}

## Sampling from the prior

This part corresponds to [Bayesian Linear Regression part 1: plotting samples from the weight prior]({% post_url 2018-01-03-bayesian-linreg %}).

Now I'll use `pymc3`! To [sample from the weights prior]({% post_url 2018-01-03-bayesian-linreg %}), I need to set up my model. First I'll copy over my hyperparameters from the old post.
(Note: I updated the subscript on the slope from `_w` to `_m`).



{% highlight python %}
# weights on the priors
mu_m = 0
mu_b = 0

sigma_m = 0.2
sigma_b = 0.2
{% endhighlight %}




[Before]({% post_url 2018-01-03-bayesian-linreg %}) I sampled weights from the prior using:

    w = np.random.randn(line_count, D) @ V_0 + w_0


Because \\( V_0 \\) is a diagonal matrix, this is like sampling from two single-variable Gaussians:

$$w_b \sim \mathcal N(\texttt{mu_b}, \texttt{sigma_b})$$

$$w_m \sim \mathcal N(\texttt{mu_m}, \texttt{sigma_m})$$


In `pymc3`, defining this model and sampling some weights from a model looks like:



{% highlight python %}
mu_w = 0
mu_b = 0

sigma_w = 0.2
sigma_b = 0.2

model = pm.Model()

with model:
    m = pm.Normal('m', mu=mu_m, sd=sigma_m)
    b = pm.Normal('b', mu=mu_b, sd=sigma_b)
    
    prior_trace = pm.sample(200)
{% endhighlight %}




There are a few differences so far!

Importantly, by assuming the independence in the priors, `pymc3` is going to learn a model that assumes \\( w_b \\) and \\( w_m \\) are independent. *This is different than the original post*, which also learned a covariance between the two weights.

Aside from the model set up, the action is already a little different! Before I was sampling from the normal distribution using `np.random.randn`, which can be done by sampling from a uniform distribution (a super common operation) and applying a transformation to it to scale it as a Gaussian.

`pymc3` uses fancier sampling approaches (my [last post on Gibbs sampling]({% post_url 2018-05-09-gibbs-sampling %}) is another fancy sampling approach!) This is going to be a common theme in this post: The Gaussian linear regression model I'm using in these posts is a small Gaussian model, which is easy to work with and has a closed-form for its posterior. But this doesn't work in complex models, so `pymc3` uses approximate methods like fancy sampling instead. In other words, I'm using fancy things in `pymc3` that are overkill for my particular model.


### Visualizing

Next I can plot some of the slopes/intercepts sampled from the prior. It looks similar to the plots I got in my [last post]({% post_url 2018-01-03-bayesian-linreg %}).

## Sampling from the Posterior

This part corresponds to [Bayesian Linear Regression part 3: Posterior]({% post_url 2018-01-09-bayesian-linreg-posterior %}) and [Bayesian Linear Regression part 4: Plots]({% post_url 2018-01-10-bayesian-linreg-plots %}).

In the posterior [post]({% post_url 2018-01-09-bayesian-linreg-posterior %}), I had a closed-form for the posterior of a Gaussian likelihood with a Gaussian prior. 

In `pymc3`, I create a deterministic random variable `exp_f` that is \\( f = mx + b \\), where `m` and `b` are the random variables defined above, and `x` are the x-values for the observed data. I set that as the mean of a Normal distribution with the \\( \sigma_y \\) noise (and like the other posts assume I know the true noise `sigma_y = true_sigma_y`.) Then I can pass the observed values `Y` I came up with at the beginning. Then I sample again!



{% highlight python %}
sigma_y = true_sigma_y

# Use the model defined above
with model:
    exp_f = m * x + b
    
    Y_obs = pm.Normal('Y_obs', mu=exp_f, sd=sigma_y, observed=Y)
    
    posterior_trace = pm.sample(200, tune=1000)
{% endhighlight %}




Now I can plot a few of these. This is jumping ahead to "Sampling from the posterior" in [Bayesian Linear Regression part 4: Plots]({% post_url 2018-01-10-bayesian-linreg-plots %}). This is another interesting thing about `pymc3` approaches. 
Before, I used the [closed-form of the mean and variance]({% post_url 2018-01-09-bayesian-linreg-posterior %}) of the normal distribution that represents the posterior. Then I sampled from that distribution to plot samples from the posterior.

Using `pymc3`, I skip computing the posterior, and instead use clever methods to sample directly from the posterior. This is useful when the posterior is hard to compute.

`pymc3` also gives me a cool plot of the samples.



{% highlight python %}
pm.traceplot(posterior_trace)
{% endhighlight %}

## Thoughts: Plotting error

That's all I'm going to post for now. I wasn't able to recreate all of the original series' graphs using `pymc3` yet.

One of my favorite graphs from the series was plotting a shaded area for the uncertainty from [Bayesian Linear Regression part 4: Plots]({% post_url 2018-01-10-bayesian-linreg-plots %}). There are two issues: in this post, I'm assuming the slope and intercept are independent, which is slightly different than that post, and I _think_ that means the uncertainty is incorrectly clumped around 0 (because the form of the function that plots the uncertainty is based on \\( ax^2 + 2bx + c \\), where \\( b \\) is the covariance.) I started using `pm.MvGaussian`, which would find a covariance between the slope and intercept, but `pm.summary(posterior_trace)` gives me separate standard deviations for individual variables. I'll post a follow-up if I can sort this out!
