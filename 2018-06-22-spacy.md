It's been a few days since I've posted, so this is a quick post about what I've been experimenting with: `spaCy`, a natural language processing library.


## Why use a natural language processing library like `spaCy`

Natural language processing gets complicated fast.
For example, it's surprisingly tricky to divide text into sentences and words. A naive approach would be to split on whitespace and periods. It's easy to find a sentence that breaks these rules, such as

    I'll drive to Mt. Hood on Friday!

An NLP library like `spaCy` can divide `I'll` into two separate tokens `I` and `'ll`.  The library can also tell that not all periods are the end of a sentence (e.g. `Mt.`), and that there is punctuation other than `.` (e.g. `!`). These rules will depend on the language; `spaCy` has an English model that works for my purposes.

Aside from sentence boundary detection and tokenization, `spaCy` can tag parts-of-speech of words (`drive` is a `VERB`), say `'ll` is the same as `will`, parse the sentence (the `drive` is `on Friday`), along with other [linguistics features](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features). It also has a nice set-up for adding custom attributes using [pipelines](https://spacy.io/usage/processing-pipelines). 


An alternative natural language processing library to `spaCy` is [`nltk`](https://www.nltk.org). `nltk` also comes with a lovely free [book](https://www.nltk.org/book/) on natural language processing.

### Installation spaCy

The lovely [documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/) explain how to install the package and a language model. I installed the English model.



{% highlight python %}
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load('en')
{% endhighlight %}




### Sentence boundary detection and tokenization

I can use `nlp` to parse the text and get a `Doc`. This takes a bit of time, but then further processing is fast. The length of the `Doc` (`len(doc)`) gives the number of words (`Tokens`). To get the number of sentences, I can count the sentences (`Span`) from `doc.sents`.



{% highlight python %}
doc = nlp('''\
I wondered if I could write a program to automatically catch clumsy style mistakes I often make.
I'll try using spaCy!
It turns out style-checking is a little complicated, so this post is actually just about spaCy.
''')

print('''
words\t\t{num_words}
sentences\t{num_sent}
'''.format(
    num_words=len(doc),  # grab number of tokens
    num_sent=len(list(doc.sents)),
))
{% endhighlight %}




    words		47
    sentences	3

### Tokenization

I can also see how `spaCy` tokenizes my example from above:

     I'll drive to Mt. Hood on Friday!
     
Indeed, `spaCy` doesn't split the sentence at `Mt.` and does split `I'll` into the tokens `I` and `'ll`.



{% highlight python %}
doc = nlp("I'll drive to Mt. Hood on Friday!")

for sentence in doc.sents:
    print('\t'.join(str(token) for token in sentence))
{% endhighlight %}




    I	'll	drive	to	Mt.	Hood	on	Friday	!

### Lemmatization

I can get root words by checking out what `token.lemma_` gives (`.lemma` without the underscore is a special ID.)
It converts `'ll` into `will` and `Mt.` into `Mount`!



{% highlight python %}
for sentence in doc.sents:
    print('\t'.join(str(token) for token in sentence))
    print('\t'.join(token.lemma_ for token in sentence))
{% endhighlight %}




    I	'll	drive	to	Mt.	Hood	on	Friday	!
    -PRON-	will	drive	to	Mount	hood	on	friday	!

### Detour: highlighting words

Switching gears for a moment, I can use `IPython.display` to make funner output in Jupyter notebook [like before](https://jessicastringham.net/2018/05/07/reading-jupyter-notebooks-into-Python.html). `highlight_doc` will take a `Doc` and a function that says whether a given token should be highlighted.



{% highlight python %}
from IPython.display import display, Markdown


def _highlight_word(word):
    return '<span style="color:blue">**{}**</span>'.format(word)

def highlight_doc(doc, should_highlight_func):
    '''Display a word.

    doc: spacy.Doc that should be highlighted
    should_highlight_func: a function that takes in a spacy.Token and returns True
      or False depending on if the token should be highlighted
    '''
    for sentence in doc.sents:
        markdown_sentence = []
        for token in sentence:
            markdown_word = token.text

            if should_highlight_func(token):
                markdown_word = _highlight_word(markdown_word)

            markdown_sentence.append(markdown_word)
        display(Markdown(' '.join(markdown_sentence)))
{% endhighlight %}




### Highlighting verbs

To test the UI, I can highlight verbs by checking the [`token`'s `pos` attribute](https://spacy.io/api/annotation#pos-tagging). (In this case, I can use `.pos` instead of `.pos_` so I can compare with `spacy.symbols.VERB`.)



{% highlight python %}
from spacy.symbols import VERB

doc = nlp('''\
I wondered if I could write a program to automatically catch clumsy style mistakes I often make.
I'll try using spaCy!
It turns out style-checking is a little complicated, so this post is actually just about spaCy.
''')

highlight_doc(doc, lambda token: token.pos == VERB)
{% endhighlight %}




I <span style="color:blue">**wondered**</span> if I <span style="color:blue">**could**</span> <span style="color:blue">**write**</span> a program to automatically <span style="color:blue">**catch**</span> clumsy style mistakes I often <span style="color:blue">**make**</span> . 

I <span style="color:blue">**'ll**</span> <span style="color:blue">**try**</span> <span style="color:blue">**using**</span> spaCy ! 

It <span style="color:blue">**turns**</span> out style - checking <span style="color:blue">**is**</span> a little complicated , so this post <span style="color:blue">**is**</span> actually just about spaCy . 

### Named entities

`spaCy` also extracts a few neat natural language processing. For example, it can highlight [named entities](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#section-named-entities), which is often hard to do!
It says Mt. Hood is a "Buildings, airports, highways, bridges, etc." Neat!



{% highlight python %}
# this will be a little hard to read if noun chunks are near each other
doc = nlp("I'll drive to Mt. Hood on Friday!")

# get a list of token indexes that are in a noun_chunk
is_in_named_entity = set(sum((list(range(entity.start, entity.end)) for entity in doc.ents), []))

highlight_doc(doc, lambda token: token.i in is_in_named_entity)

for entity in doc.ents:
    print(entity, entity.label_)
{% endhighlight %}




I 'll drive to <span style="color:blue">**Mt.**</span> <span style="color:blue">**Hood**</span> on <span style="color:blue">**Friday**</span> !

    Mt. Hood FAC
    Friday DATE

## Etc

This was a quick post introducing a few features of `spaCy`. Assembling them into a real project is another challenge!

`spaCy` is an interesting project. It's neat to see how NLP and AI can be used in a usable package. 
The [`spaCy`](https://spacy.io) documentation is lots of fun. One tip is to jump between similarly-named sections, like POS tagging, in "Usage", "Models", and "API".
