Sometimes the APIs I want to use for a project only return data in the XML format.
I usually grumble about me forgetting how to use `xml.etree.elementtree`, glance at the documentation, and then search StackOverflow until I can cobble together something that extracts the data I need. Then I move on to other parts of the project and forget how to use `xml.etree.elementtree` again.

This time around, I decided to consciously learn `xml.etree.elementtree` by taking notes on it,
with the added motivation of making a blog post on it.
I think the [`xml.etree.elementtree` tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html)
was already very useful, so I turned parts of the tutorial into a graphic.
