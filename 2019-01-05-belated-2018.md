It's the beginning of 2019, and as I'm <a href='{% post_url 2018-01-02-belated-2017 %}'>establishing as tradition</a>, this post is a review of 2018.

In 2018, I completed my masters at Edinburgh. I moved to Sweden to start a new job involving machine learning and data engineering. I also wrote 38 blog posts this year!

## Blog posts

During the month of May, I had a month off for studying and finals. I studied Machine Learning, went to coffee shops, read, ran, and wrote blog posts. I couldn't complain!

Here are a few posts:

#### Small ML projects
 - <a href="/2018/06/11/climate-classification-with-neural-nets.html">Neural net embeddings that classify climate surprisingly well!</a> (2018/06/11)
 - <a href="/2018/05/27/coffee.html">Bayesian ranking Edinburgh coffee shops</a> (2018/05/27)
 - <a href="/2018/05/16/library-catalog-subject.html">Embedding book topics from the Seattle Public Library</a> (2018/05/16)

#### Big personal software projects

 - <a href="/2018/08/28/daisy.html">Managing neural net experiments for my research.</a> (2018/08/28)
 - <a href="/2018/05/06/studying.html">How I studied for my masters.</a> (2018/05/06)
 - <a href="/2018/12/30/thesis.html">My master's thesis on seq2seq.</a> (2018/12/30)

#### ML Concepts

 - <a href="/2018/12/27/KL-Divergence.html">Minimizing KL Divergence using TensorFlow</a> (2018/12/27)
 - <a href="/2018/05/02/hmm-alpha-recursion.html">Alpha Recursion in Hidden Markov Models</a> (2018/05/02)
 - <a href="/2018/05/18/Gaussian-Processes.html">Gaussian Processes</a> (2018/05/18)

I also posted on data science tech (<a href="/2018/01/01/einsum.html">einsum</a>),
data engineering tech (<a href="/2018/06/07/dbpedia.html">DBpedia</a>),
graphics (<a href="/2018/09/21/xml.html">`xml.etree.elementtree` Cheatsheet</a>),
and places and events (<a href="/2018/01/04/narvik-kiruna.html">Narvik, Norway and Kiruna, Sweden</a>).

I also started writing some posts as <a href="https://github.com/jessstringham/notebooks">Jupyter notebooks</a>.

## Places and events

### Home bases

* Edinburgh, UK
* Uppsala, Sweden (commuting to Stockholm)


### Events

 * The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Great_Britain_and_Ireland_cold_wave">_Beast from the East_</a> made Edinburgh look different!

 * The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe">Edinburgh Festival</a> happened while I was writing my thesis! It felt like a different city.


### New places

Some new places I've visited are
- Cambridge and Glasgow in the UK
- <a href="https://www.tillamook.com/creamery/index.html">The new cheese factory in Tillamook, Oregon.</a> I am now the proud owner of this foam cheese representing my nostalgia for Oregon.

In addition to podcasts from last year's list:

 - **More Perfect**
 - **Pivot with Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway**
