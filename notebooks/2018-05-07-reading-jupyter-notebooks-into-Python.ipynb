       "The goal of *filtering* is to show the probability distribution over the locations in the room at a given timestep $t$ given the bumps/creaks from the current and previous timesteps, $p(h_t\\mid v_{1:t})$. Plotting this distribution at each timestep gives a heatmap of where in the room we think the person is. \n",
       "\n",
       "In this model, there is a transition distribution $p(h_t \\mid h_{t - 1})$ to show that each hidden state depends on the previous timestep's hidden state. There also is the emission distribution $p(v_t \\mid h_t)$ to show each visible state depends on the corresponding hidden state. There's also the probability of where in the room the person starts, $p(h_1)$.\n",

       "The rest of the notebook shows:\n",
       " - Setting up the known distributions $p(h_1)$, $p(h_t \\mid h_{t - 1})$, and $p(v_t \\mid h_t)$. This is a lot of the notebook!\n",
       " - Generating some data for the locations ($h_{1:t}$) and sounds ($v_{1:t}$) from that distribution.\n",
